# Overview
This is a simple web application that imitates the functionality of Google Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search. It allows users to search for web pages or images using a search query, just like in Google.

# Functionality
The application has three main features:

1. Google Search: The user can enter a search query and click the "Google Search" button to perform a Google search. Alternatively, they can click the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button to go to the top search result directly.
2. Image Search: The user can enter a search query for images and click the "Google Search" button to perform a Google image search.
3. Advanced Search: The user can click on the "Advanced Search" button to access a page that allows them to enter more specific search criteria. They can enter phrases they want included or excluded using the "all these words", "exact word or phrase", "any of these words", and "none of these words" fields.

# Usage
To use the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You can enter your search query in the search box on the homepage and click the "Google Search" button to search for web pages. Click the "Image" button to switch to image search. Click the "Advanced Search" button to go to the advanced search page.

On the advanced search page, you can enter your search criteria in the different fields and click the "Google Search" button to search for web pages that match the criteria.

# Credits
This project uses Bootstrap for the styling and jQuery for the interactivity. It is inspired by the design and functionality of Google Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search.
